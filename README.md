## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structure     
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout     
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – for stopwatch functionality

## 📖 How It Works

1. When you click the **Start** button, JavaScript begins updating the timer at set intervals.    
2. The **Pause** button stops the interval without resetting the time.    
3. The **Reset** button clears the interval and sets the time back to `00:00:00`.    
4. The UI updates dynamically with every tick.
